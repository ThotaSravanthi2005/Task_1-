Netflix Dataset Cleaning Report

Overview:  
I began with a raw Netflix dataset containing 8,807 titles (movies and TV shows). While the data was largely complete, it required targeted cleaning to ensure accuracy for analysis. Here’s how I prepared it:  

1. Handling Missing Data:  
- Empty director/country fields**: Over 2,600 entries lacked director information, and 831 had no country listed. Instead of deleting these (which would skew the dataset), I replaced nulls with "Unknown" to preserve the data volume.  
- Missing ratings: A handful of titles (10) had no rating. These were marked as "Not Rated" to maintain consistency.  

2. Standardizing Format:  
- Dates: Converted various date formats (like "January 1, 2020") into a uniform `YYYY-MM-DD` structure for easier analysis.  
- Durations:  
  - Movies: Transformed entries like "90 min" into numeric values (`90`) to calculate averages.  
  - TV Shows: Standardized season listings (e.g., "Season 1" → "1 Season").  
- Text cleanup: Lowercased all column names (e.g., `Show_Id` → `show_id`) and unified country names (e.g., "US" and "U.S.A." became "United States").  

3. Quality Checks:
- Duplicates: The dataset had no exact duplicates (verified using Pandas’ `drop_duplicates()`).  
- Data types: Ensured `release_year` was numeric and `date_added` was datetime for accurate trend analysis.  

4. Impact on Analysis:  
These changes enabled clear insights:  
- Content split: 69.6% Movies (6,131) vs. 30.4% TV Shows (2,676).  
- Production trends: Peak movie releases occurred in 2017–2018, with 767 titles each year.  
- Top durations: The most common movie length was 90 minutes (152 titles), while most TV shows had just 1 season.  

Key Decisions from my task completion:
- Preserved all rows to avoid biasing the dataset.  
- Chose clarity over deletion(e.g., "Unknown" labels for missing directors).  
- Prioritized analysis-ready formats (e.g., numeric durations for calculations).
